Pietari Kaasinen - bio

A composer of Finnish and Swedish nationality, Pietari Kaasinen (b. 1992) tends to operate within grey areas found between different genres and styles.
His concert works have been performed in Finland and in Sweden - by Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra in 2017, among others - and he collaborates frequently with artists from other disciplines.

Kaasinen is currently pursuing a degree at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm, and holds a BA in Music from Tampere University of Applied Sciences, where he studied composition under D.Mus. Hannu Pohjannoro and cello under Markus Hohti.
Kaasinen also holds a Bachelor of Social Sciences from Uppsala University.

Kaasinen's work has been supported by the Finnish Cultural Foundation.
